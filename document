Overview of B/G Deployment
Blue Environment: Contains the current version of the application.
Green Environment: Contains the new version of the application.
Traffic Management: Route 53 will manage DNS records to control traffic flow between the blue and green environments.
Backend Database: Both environments will connect to a shared or dedicated database instance.
Steps to Achieve B/G Deployment
1. Infrastructure Setup
The Terraform code provided earlier sets up two Auto Scaling Groups, two ALBs, and necessary networking components. Ensure you have:

Two EC2 Auto Scaling Groups: One for the blue environment and one for the green environment.
Two ALBs: Each routing traffic to their respective ASG.
Route 53: To manage DNS records that will point to the appropriate ALB based on traffic routing.
2. Database Setup
For the backend database, you have two primary options:

Single Shared Database: Both environments connect to a single database. This is common but requires careful handling of migrations and changes.
Dedicated Databases: Each environment has its own database instance. This isolates environments but can complicate deployment and data synchronization.
